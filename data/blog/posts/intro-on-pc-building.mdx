# Introduction

Learning how to build a PC is a daunting task and there are a lot of things to keep note of.
From planning to building, not everyone has the time or patience to worry about these types of things.

Hopefully, this post will be able to get you up to speed on what PC building is and what to look out for when building!

# Why build your own?

People have different reasons for building their own PC as opposed to buying a [prebuilt PC](https://www.msi.com/blog/pre-built-pc-vs-custom-pc-best-choice) outright, but here are some pros and cons of building your own:

### Pros:

- Have full control over what parts you want to put in your PC (i.e custom PCs).
- Don't need to pay others to build the PC for you.
- Relatively easy (YMMV) to learn.
- Parts will usually be swappable/upgradable as opposed to prebuilts (which may have parts that are locked to a specific generation or type).

### Cons:

- Not as convenient as buying an prebuilt.
- The chance of breaking your part(s) if you're not careful.
- Often more expensive (or about even) compared to prebuilts.
- Needs to be somewhat familiar with working with technology.
