# Introduction

Learning how to build a PC is a daunting task and there are a lot of things to keep note of.
From planning to building, not everyone has the time or patience to worry about these types of things.

Hopefully, this post will be able to get you up to speed on what PC building is and what to look out for when building!

4/23/2022 EDIT: While creating this guide, I found out the tech Youtube channel [Linus Tech Tips](https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips) made a all-in-one guide on PC Building (how convenient!). After watching it over, I can conclude that this guide is effectively moot due to the fact that the guys over there can explain things much more in-depth than I could here.
Without further ado, here it is:
