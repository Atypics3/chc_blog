# Welcome to the Blog!

This blog is meant to be a resource hub for computer hardware.
While it's tailored to be for Chabot's Computer Hardware Club, I try to make it to be a general, easy-to-read blog that anyone can understand.

This blog will be periodically updated whenever I have free time to compile and write up blog posts.
I hope that this blog will be informative and have reliable information (and sources).
