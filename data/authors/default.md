Hey there!
My name's Edwin and I am a Comp. Sci. major at Chabot College. I am also the club president of Chabot's Computer Hardware Club, hence is why this blog site was created.

Speaking of which, more of what/why this blog exists is in this [post](https://chcblog.vercel.app/blog/posts/intro).

When not experimenting with stuff on the web or with hardware, you can find me playing a variety of games and doing other stuff.

If you want to reach me, you can find me on [Github](https://github.com/Atypics3) and [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/KBEVUrZmW8). All my other contacts + my email address are also listed here.
