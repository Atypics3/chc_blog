# Introduction

Adapted from [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XHicpsC3UhjVRfJ_dZ9KKekVXbULy0VRg9i3dkNABgY/edit?usp=sharing).

Making a website can be daunting but it doesn't have to be! By the end of this guide, you'll learn how to build your own website.

NOTE: This guide won't go into the step-by-step on how to build websites, but rather give a overview of the components and other stuff relating to them.

TL;DR: Go to the `General Resources` section and click on any (or all) the links.

## Components

The foundation of building a website comes from these three main components:

### HTML

HTML stands for `H`yper`T`ext `M`arkup `L`anguage and it is the foundation of the majority of websites (and the World Wide Web).
While it isn't technically a programming language, it is important to learn it and know how it works if you want to build a website.

The way that HTML works is by using these symbols, `<>` , called tags. These tags can do various things inside of them.
Some of these include:

- `<p>`, which puts anything between the starting tag and a ending tag as part of a paragraph.
- `<body>`, which denotes the content that is inside the tag as the main content of the website.
  and
- `<div>`, which denotes a division and is used for dividing up content into divisions, essentially dividing up the main content into smaller ones.

More information and examples can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).

### CSS

CSS stands for `C`ascading `S`tyle`S`heets and is used to customize the way that a website is presented to the user. In other words, it is what stylizes and makes websites good-looking.

To avoid making this long, this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS#css_syntax) will explain CSS (and its syntax) better than I could.
Some of the more popular [CSS frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework) include:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/) (for [React](https://reactjs.org/))
- [More CSS frameworks listed here](https://athemes.com/collections/best-css-frameworks/)

### JS

JS (or short for `J`ava`S`cript) is a [scripting language](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-scripting-language) that is usually paired with HTMl and CSS to create fully-functional websites.

Not to be confused with [Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/java_javascript.html), JS is almost always used in creating websites due to its nature of being versatile (can work with nearly anything) and lightweight (low storage capacity).
Some popular [JS frameworks](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-a-javascript-framework) include:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [More JS frameworks here](https://hackr.io/blog/best-javascript-frameworks)

# Goals of a website

While everyone have different standards and goals of websites, here are three main goals people generally strive for:

1. Readable and full functionality (optimally)
1. Web responsive (meaning it can be viewed the same way on a phone, tablet, laptop, PC, etc.)
1. Just making it work (at least as a [MVP](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27809/minimum-viable-product-mvp))

## Example of a website

A boilerplate website would look something like this:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <meta charset="utf-8">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
   <title>repl.it</title>
   <link href="index.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
 </head>
 <body>
   <p>Here's some regular html, p5 canvas gets appended to the end</p>
   <p>Move the mouse to randomize the colors!</p>
   <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.0/p5.min.js"></script>
   <script src="index.js"></script>
 </body>
</html>

```

If you paste it in some text editor, it would look something like this!

<Image
  alt="picture describing a website that has some text on it"
  src="/static/images/websiteBuildingandDeploying/exampleWebsiteContent.jpg"
  width={1143}
  height={291}
/>

## Things to Note

- Can put everything into a HTML file, but not in a CSS file or a JS file(usually).
- Everyone has their own style of doing things.
- How things are displayed (at first) depends on your resolution (mainly) and monitor size.

# Free Deployment

Deploying a website can be a headache and a drain on the wallet, but here are some free website hosting to alleviate some of the pain:

- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Repl.it](https://replit.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Each have their own methods of doing things and may range from easy to hard.

## Paid Alternatives

If you prefer to skip deploying your website by yourself altogether, there are realistically two options:

- Website builders (Wix, Wordpress, Squarespace, etc.)
- Paying someone else to do it for you

# Epilogue

You've reached the end of the guide! Hopefully, you were able to learn a thing or two (I know I did) about the foundation of website building (and deploying).

# General Resources

For general help:

- https://html.com/ (has a decent tutorial on your first HTML webpage)
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web (essentially the go-to doc for any web dev)
- https://www.browserstack.com/responsive (for testing website responsiveness on any device)
- https://eloquentjavascript.net/ (An in-depth e-textbook about JS and programming with it)

For testing out things:
(both roughly function the same.)
